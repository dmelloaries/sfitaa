            Can I join as a student and how will that benefit me?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Yes, you can join as a student even before you graduate. One can
            achieve the skills of teamwork and management while organizing
            seminars throughout the year. The Rekindle organized by SFITAA is a
            good way to interact with the alumni. In all, itâ€™s a good way to
            explore and polish your skills.
